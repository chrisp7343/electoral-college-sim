*** I created this project as an extension of my interest in political data and analysis, which I've
*** been interested in since the 2020 election. I originally coded this on Python and ran it on the
*** terminal, before transitioning it to a static website earlier this year.

*** The simulator was optimized using Python and an Excel sheet for me to track different statistics
*** for each state. Each party has a 49.82% chance of winning the electoral college (~0.36% chance
*** of a 269-269 tie), and a 50% chance of winning the popular vote.
